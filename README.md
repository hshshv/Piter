# Piter
Easily build a robotic spider with the Piter Library, which allows you to accurately and easily control the steps and sounds your spider will make, as well as a variety of sensors, such as a petting sensor, a movement sensor that lets you see when people are approaching, and ultrasonic distance sensors, useing arduino Mega (Later, it will be expanded and will also allow for construction through arduino uno and I2C PWM driver).
